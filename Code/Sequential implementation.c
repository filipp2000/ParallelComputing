/* Nonlinear Optimization using the algorithm of Hooke and Jeeves  */
/*	12 February 1994	author: Mark G. Johnson 	   */


/* Find a point X where the nonlinear function f(X) has a local    */
/* minimum.  X is an n-vector and f(X) is a scalar.  In mathe-	   */
/* matical notation  f: R^n -> R^1.  The objective function f()    */
/* is not required to be continuous.  Nor does f() need to be	   */
/* differentiable.  The program does not use or require 	   */
/* derivatives of f().						   */

/* The software user supplies three things: a subroutine that	   */
/* computes f(X), an initial "starting guess" of the minimum point */
/* X, and values for the algorithm convergence parameters.  Then   */
/* the program searches for a local minimum, beginning from the    */
/* starting guess, using the Direct Search algorithm of Hooke and  */
/* Jeeves.							   */

/* This C program is adapted from the Algol pseudocode found in    */
/* "Algorithm 178: Direct Search" by Arthur F. Kaupe Jr., Commun-  */
/* ications of the ACM, Vol 6. p.313 (June 1963).  It includes the */
/* improvements suggested by Bell and Pike (CACM v.9, p. 684, Sept */
/* 1966) and those of Tomlin and Smith, "Remark on Algorithm 178"  */
/* (CACM v.12).  The original paper, which I don't recommend as    */
/* highly as the one by A. Kaupe, is:  R. Hooke and T. A. Jeeves,  */
/* "Direct Search Solution of Numerical and Statistical Problems", */
/* Journal of the ACM, Vol. 8, April 1961, pp. 212-229. 	   */

/* Calling sequence:						   */
/*  int hooke(nvars, startpt, endpt, rho, epsilon, itermax)	   */
/*								   */
/*     nvars	   {an integer}  This is the number of dimensions  */
/*		   in the domain of f().  It is the number of	   */
/*		   coordinates of the starting point (and the	   */
/*		   minimum point.)				   */
/*     startpt	   {an array of doubles}  This is the user-	   */
/*		   supplied guess at the minimum.		   */
/*     endpt	   {an array of doubles}  This is the location of  */
/*		   the local minimum, calculated by the program    */
/*     rho	   {a double}  This is a user-supplied convergence */
/*		   parameter (more detail below), which should be  */
/*		   set to a value between 0.0 and 1.0.	Larger	   */
/*		   values of rho give greater probability of	   */
/*		   convergence on highly nonlinear functions, at a */
/*		   cost of more function evaluations.  Smaller	   */
/*		   values of rho reduces the number of evaluations */
/*		   (and the program running time), but increases   */
/*		   the risk of nonconvergence.	See below.	   */
/*     epsilon	   {a double}  This is the criterion for halting   */
/*		   the search for a minimum.  When the algorithm   */
/*		   begins to make less and less progress on each   */
/*		   iteration, it checks the halting criterion: if  */
/*		   the stepsize is below epsilon, terminate the    */
/*		   iteration and return the current best estimate  */
/*		   of the minimum.  Larger values of epsilon (such */
/*		   as 1.0e-4) give quicker running time, but a	   */
/*		   less accurate estimate of the minimum.  Smaller */
/*		   values of epsilon (such as 1.0e-7) give longer  */
/*		   running time, but a more accurate estimate of   */
/*		   the minimum. 				   */
/*     itermax	   {an integer}  A second, rarely used, halting    */
/*		   criterion.  If the algorithm uses >= itermax    */
/*		   iterations, halt.				   */


/* The user-supplied objective function f(x,n) should return a C   */
/* "double".  Its  arguments are  x -- an array of doubles, and    */
/* n -- an integer.  x is the point at which f(x) should be	   */
/* evaluated, and n is the number of coordinates of x.	That is,   */
/* n is the number of coefficients being fitted.		   */

/* rho, the algorithm convergence control			   */
/*	The algorithm works by taking "steps" from one estimate of */
/*    a minimum, to another (hopefully better) estimate.  Taking   */
/*    big steps gets to the minimum more quickly, at the risk of   */
/*    "stepping right over" an excellent point.  The stepsize is   */
/*    controlled by a user supplied parameter called rho.  At each */
/*    iteration, the stepsize is multiplied by rho  (0 < rho < 1), */
/*    so the stepsize is successively reduced.			   */
/*	Small values of rho correspond to big stepsize changes,    */
/*    which make the algorithm run more quickly.  However, there   */
/*    is a chance (especially with highly nonlinear functions)	   */
/*    that these big changes will accidentally overlook a	   */
/*    promising search vector, leading to nonconvergence.	   */
/*	Large values of rho correspond to small stepsize changes,  */
/*    which force the algorithm to carefully examine nearby points */
/*    instead of optimistically forging ahead.	This improves the  */
/*    probability of convergence.				   */
/*	The stepsize is reduced until it is equal to (or smaller   */
/*    than) epsilon.  So the number of iterations performed by	   */
/*    Hooke-Jeeves is determined by rho and epsilon:		   */
/*	    rho**(number_of_iterations) = epsilon		   */
/*	In general it is a good idea to set rho to an aggressively */
/*    small value like 0.5 (hoping for fast convergence).  Then,   */
/*    if the user suspects that the reported minimum is incorrect  */
/*    (or perhaps not accurate enough), the program can be run	   */
/*    again with a larger value of rho such as 0.85, using the	   */
/*    result of the first minimization as the starting guess to    */
/*    begin the second minimization.				   */

/* Normal use: (1) Code your function f() in the C language	   */
/*	       (2) Install your starting guess {or read it in}	   */
/*	       (3) Run the program				   */
/*	       (4) {for the skeptical}: Use the computed minimum   */
/*		      as the starting point for another run	   */

/* Data Fitting:						   */
/*	Code your function f() to be the sum of the squares of the */
/*	errors (differences) between the computed values and the   */
/*	measured values.  Then minimize f() using Hooke-Jeeves.    */
/*	EXAMPLE: you have 20 datapoints (ti, yi) and you want to   */
/*	find A,B,C such that  (A*t*t) + (B*exp(t)) + (C*tan(t))    */
/*	fits the data as closely as possible.  Then f() is just    */
/*	f(x) = SUM (measured_y[i] - ((A*t[i]*t[i]) + (B*exp(t[i])) */
/*				  + (C*tan(t[i]))))^2		   */
/*	where x[] is a 3-vector consisting of {A, B, C}.	   */
